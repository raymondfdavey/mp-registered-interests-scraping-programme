    "# MPs Registered interests\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a project to scrape and process MP registered interests data which is not currently available on the parliamentary API.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is presented as a list of XML files at https://www.theyworkforyou.com/pwdata/scrapedxml/regmem/ which are indexed by date.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is somewhat messy (not toooo bad, not perfect) and a new register is added every month. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to design a process/app that will gather all of the data from a specified date, and refactor it into a reasonably consistent JSON format. I will then use NODE.js app to seed this to a MONGO DB on atlas and make a back end to a simple web and mobile app in flutter that people can use to find out what is actually quite inaccessable but publicaly available and pertinent information.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, I have written code which will scrape the XML data from a specified date,save it to JSON, and then refactor this into a more consistent/workable JSON. On running it will check if any of the files are already present and then skip them. This will allow new records to be added. \n",
    "\n",
    "I realise that I have devided the process up into steps that could be merged (i.e. I could go straight from XML to the refactored JSON) but I had to do a lot of inspection of the original JSON to figure out how to clean it up a bit, and also I quite enjoy how clear the different steps are. \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that running these scripts will download data from the internet onto your computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Set up - \n",
    "    If you want to run this notebook and see it working (which you may not want to do considering I going to hopefully have a site which displays all the info nicely) then I recommend that you create a new directory (call it what you will - mps_reg_interests_data maybe?) with this notebook in it. Then in that directory you need three other empty directories\n",

    "NOTE/WARNING \n",
    "    There is a lot of data - be careful when you pick a start date as if you pick 2010 or something that is 10 * 12 times 5 times circa 400 mps times many interests. and it might take ages to run on your computer. \n",
